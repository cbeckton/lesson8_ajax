### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (In this assignment we learned about an API key. It is a code that is used within a program's code in order to call information from the API. The key tracks and controls how the API is being used, for example, if the information was being abused it could be tracked and stopped.)
2. (In this lesson we learned about Javascript Object Notation (JSON) which is a language that is easy to analyze and write. JSON-based API is becoming populary used by websites in order to share information with developers; websites accumalate so much information that other applications can be developed from what they've collected.)
